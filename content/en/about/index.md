Organised by the philosophy faculty at [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/), The Shanghai Lecture in Philosophy aims to build a platform for exchange between philosophers inside and outside China. Each year the series invites one world-renowned philosopher to Shanghai to give a public lecture. Video recordings are [made available to the public](https://www.youtube.com/@shanghai-lecture), and written versions of the lectures are published in [The Asian Journal of Philosophy](https://link.springer.com/journal/44204) (in English) and [Philosophical Analysis](https://zxfx.cbpt.cnki.net/WKC3/WebPublication/index.aspx?mid=zxfx) (in Chinese).
